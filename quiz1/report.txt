Summary of Project 1

1. Function coverage: 100%

2. Line coverage: 83.8%

3. Branch coverage: 71.9%

4. Total number of test cases: 72 (in sub groups)

5. Number of passed test cases: all but one.  Turns out a lot of what I tested was happy path this time around.  the segfault was the only glaring part.  

6. Number of failed test cases: only the one.  I'd need to talk to a developer about formatting though.  a lot of the error messages are divergent for formatting. Also inconsistent

7. Did you trigger the segmentation fault?  Yes.  I create a test flow just for the seg fault as simple as I could make it.

8. What test case triggered the segmentation fault?  titled segfault.  :-) it was trying to remove a non empty stack.




my method for dev:
run program, add tests, check coverage with this:
gcov -b -c *.c ; lcov --capture --rc lcov_branch_coverage=1 --directory ./ --output-file coverage.info ; genhtml coverage.info --rc lcov_branch_coverage=1 --output-directory result ; firefox result/index.html 


I there out my early 90% 92% 100% html result and exercised purely from test.  That was purely from exercising the software.  :-)  I know how to write these, they just take time, and the tool is less familiar.  I also know how to break software.  Gotta love it!
