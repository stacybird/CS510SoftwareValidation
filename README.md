CS 510 Topics in Software Validation coursework April, May, June 2015

This repo coursework includes:

+ Week 1 first testing using expect to test a program clic-2
+ Quiz 1, the real-time demo of knowledge I learned as an in-class timed exercise (turn out no one probably finished, we were all trying for 80, 90% passing in two, three hours, and we were all still frantically adding tests when time was called.  In retrospect, I shouldn't have thrown my manual driving to the app that showed a much higher percentage than I had time to put under test.)
